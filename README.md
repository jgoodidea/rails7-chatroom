# README

This project is a real chat room for Ruby on Rails. It includes public and private chat rooms with functionalities for text messages, audio recordings, file messages, unread notifications and so on.

In this project I used and learnt many ruby gems such as devise, noticed, pagy, chartkick, and capistrano.
Mainly I developed skills to utilize stimulus and turbo streams.
